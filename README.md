# Dead Weight 2.0 Refactor

A complete refactor of my game Dead Weight, updated to actually quality code standards. As of last update, it was intended to be kept private until perfect, but I realized it's better to let people see it as is while I continue to fix it up, even if you see my nonsense commit messages to myself or some code that needs cleaning up.

Dead Weight was created for the GoedWare Jam #9 theme "broken physics." It's a 2d metroidvania with entirely physics based movement, as you try to save two characters who are tethered together.

PS: the "bugs I can't solve" was referring to skeleton2d issues with Godot, something I could learn how to fix on the engine level, but decided to work around instead.
